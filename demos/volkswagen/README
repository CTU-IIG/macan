This demo is for testing with Volkswagen implementation of timeserver,
keyserver and their macan gateway with our node. There is directory called
"test" which contains scripts which help launching the demo:

* init-vcan.sh
This script creates virtual CAN interfaces needed by this demo. This is the
first script you should run.

* ks.sh
Launches VW keyserver

* ts.sh

* node-vw.sh
Launches VW macan gateway

* node-ctu.sh
Launches our node

* macanmon.sh

There is also file "path.sh" which contains paths to binaries and configs, you
should edit it to fit your needs. Scripts above do not need any command line
parameters, everything is in the script in case you want to change something.
