4 signals demo
==============

This demo shows communication between 2 nodes. There are 4 signals
(16bit and 32bit) with different parameters and prescalers (see
macan_config.c). All signals are transmitted by node #2 and received by
node #3.

There is a directory called "test" which contains scripts which help
launching the demo:

* init-vcan.sh
This script creates virtual CAN interfaces needed by this demo. This is
the first script you should run.

* ks.sh
Launches keyserver (ECU-ID #0)

* ts.sh
Launches timeserver (ECU-ID #1)

* node2.sh
Launches node (ECU-ID #2)

* node3.sh
Launches our node (ECU-ID #3)

* macanmon.sh
Launches macan monitor (optional)

There is also file "path.sh" which contains paths to binaries and
configs, you should edit it to fit your needs. Scripts above do not need
any command line parameters, everything is in the script in case you
want to change something.
