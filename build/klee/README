KLEE target serves for symbolic testing of the MaCAN library using KLEE.

This has non-trivial dependencies, and build process.
The rough outline is that you need to build Clang+LLVM+compiler-rt
in version 3.3, build STP and then build KLEE.

Afterwards you also need to download WLLVM and set it up to use aforementioned
Clang version.
