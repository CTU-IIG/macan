KLEE target serves for symbolic testing of the MaCAN library using KLEE.

This has non-trivial dependencies, and build process.
The rough outline is that you need to build Clang+LLVM+compiler-rt
in version 3.3, build STP and then build KLEE.

Afterwards you also need to download WLLVM and set it up to use aforementioned
Clang version.

To get the whole setup without pain, clone
https://github.com/wentasah/klee-setup-horenmar.git and run make. Then
setup the needed environment variables by running ". ./setup.env".
